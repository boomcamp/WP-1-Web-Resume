# Introduction

Traditional paper resumes are ubiquitous and have their advantages. They’re convenient, lightweight, and concise. However, job seekers now have another option – to create a dedicated website for their resume.

A resume website serves the same purpose as the physical alternative and contains much of the same information. It lists the job seeker’s work history, skills, and so on. Also, just like a physical resume, a resume website’s design should grab the attention of employers and solicit interviews or offers.

However, an online resume has a number of advantages. It’s more flexible, and better able to convey a sense of personal style. In addition, a resume website is easy to share with anyone, and potential employers can stumble across it online. Most importantly, it can help you stand out in a vast sea of applicants.

The essential elements of a resume website

When you create a resume website, it should reflect who you are, rather than simply adhere to a specific template. At the same time, there are a few elements you’ll almost certainly want to include. These are:


### My Work History

* You can add your work history from your previous Boom.Camp expirience.

* Technical Skills, Programming languages etc

### Character References

* These are the people that can contact by the employer

### Contact information

* Your cellphone number, phone, email etc.

### Portfolio

* Samples of your past work (e.g Javascript Projects, AddresBook, Handraiser).

### Biography

* Your short personal biography.

### Achievements

* Any relevant certifications, awards, and so on..

### Contact us

* A contact form that can use by the employer.

### Download Resume

* A downloadable version of your physical resume (optional).

# Url

* Every web page should be in a readable and freindly format url e.g `http://localhost/jino-resume/my-work-history`

# Plugin

For our resume website we will need to create a plugin that will display the `Work history` this should be an external api or by using the github [gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thomasdavis/c9dcfa1b37dec07fb2ee7f36d7278105/raw/eb7968eb551bee9e3136b420394549b9680439d4/resume.json)

Tools/Helpers:

* [gist](https://gist.github.com/)

* [Live JSON Generator](http://www.objgen.com/json)

* [Parse JSON from remote APIs](https://pippinsplugins.com/using-wp_remote_get-to-parse-json-from-remote-apis/)


# Theme and Design

Option#1: Use [one pager template](https://wordpress.org/themes/search/one%20pager/) which is often the best choice for a resume site.

Option#2: Create your theme from scratch.

# Database Design 

Create your own custom tables and implement custom queries using wordpress `wpdb` and use `WP_query` to loop the post or category.

# Finished

Submit a link to your fork of this repository to the Google Classroom assignment related to this project.

Goodluck!
