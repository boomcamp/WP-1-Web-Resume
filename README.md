# Theme functions

For our resume website we will need to create a shortcode that will display work experiences under `My Work History` page, this should be an external api or by using the github [gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thomasdavis/c9dcfa1b37dec07fb2ee7f36d7278105/raw/eb7968eb551bee9e3136b420394549b9680439d4/resume.json)

You can use the ff tools to create json

* [gist](https://gist.github.com/)

* [Live JSON Generator](http://www.objgen.com/json)

* [Parse JSON from remote APIs](https://pippinsplugins.com/using-wp_remote_get-to-parse-json-from-remote-apis/)


# Theme and Design

- Theme should be from scratch 

- Having reposive design is a bonus.

# Database Design 

- Create your own custom database and implement wordpress `new wpdb()` with various queries.

- To use`WP_query` to loop the post or category is a plus.

# Finished

Submit a link to your fork of this repository to the Google Classroom assignment related to this project.

Goodluck!
