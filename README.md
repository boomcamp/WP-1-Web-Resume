# Resume Website

Traditional paper resumes are ubiquitous and have their advantages. They’re convenient, lightweight, and concise. However, job seekers now have another option – to create a dedicated website for their resume.

A resume website serves the same purpose as the physical alternative and contains much of the same information. It lists the job seeker’s work history, skills, and so on. Also, just like a physical resume, a resume website’s design should grab the attention of employers and solicit interviews or offers.

However, an online resume has a number of advantages. It’s more flexible, and better able to convey a sense of personal style. In addition, a resume website is easy to share with anyone, and potential employers can stumble across it online. Most importantly, it can help you stand out in a vast sea of applicants.

The essential elements of a resume website

When you create a resume website, it should reflect who you are, rather than simply adhere to a specific template. At the same time, there are a few elements you’ll almost certainly want to include. These are:


### My Work History

* You can add your work history from your previous Boom.Camp expirience.

### Character References

* These are the people that can be contact by the employer

### Contact information

* You contact details cell number, phone, email etc.

### Portfolio

* Samples of your past work (e.g mini projects AddresBook, Handraiser).

### Biography

* Your short personal biography.

### Achievements

* Any relevant certifications, awards, and so on..

### Contact us

* A contact form that can use by the employer.

### Download Resume

* A downloadable version of your physical resume (optional).

# Theme and Design

In our resume website we will use [one pager template](https://wordpress.org/themes/search/one%20pager/) which is often the best choice for a resume site. It’s smart to keep your resume site concise and easy to work through quickly. After all, employers usually have a lot of applications to read.

A one-page theme also makes it easy to create dedicated sections for each type of information, such as your biography, work history, and references.


# Database Design 

There is no specific database design for our resume template you have the freedom to create the tables.
